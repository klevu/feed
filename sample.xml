Sample XML feed for indexing your store data with Klevu.
Please use a validator that supports the XML Schema 1.1 standard.
Technical documentation can be found within the referenced XSD Schema.

The Klevu schema is loosely based on Google's Product data specification,
with some modifications according to our own internal requirements:
https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112

Google feeds include a g: namespace for many elements. To make your
life easier we allow you to either include or omit this g: prefix.
For Klevu, <id>123456</id> is identical to <g:id>123456</g:id>.

             For example you might wish to include some information about the date
             and server used to generate the feed, or the currency conversion rate.
             You can omit the <meta/> element entirely if you have no use for it. -->

            <!-- REQUIRED.
                 Each item in your feed must have a unique ID.
                 If you have products, categories and cms entities which
                 can have similar IDs in your source system, they must
                 be differentiated somehow within your feed.
                 
                 You may wish to include a prefix to distinguish items from
                 other item types in your feed, for example 'p' for Products,
                 'v' for Product Variants, 'c' for Categories, etc.
            
                 The below example represents a compound product.
                 It has a Variant ID of v12345 and a Parent ID of p54321.
                 Klevu will combine this to a final ID of p54321-v12345.
                 
                 For non-compound items you should omit <item_group_id/>
                 and populate <id/> with the ID of the item, eg. p54321.
                 
                 IMPORTANT: Magento customers migrating from the Klevu extension
                 must provide the ID data in a specific format to ensure backward compatibility.
                 Please refer to the example: /examples/magento-backward-compatibility.xml -->
            <id>v12345</id>
            <item_group_id>p54321</item_group_id>
            
            <!-- OPTIONAL, KLEVU_PRODUCT assumed if omitted.
                 This particular item is a Product.
                 You can specify any item type you like, but the common Klevu
                 values are KLEVU_PRODUCT, KLEVU_CATEGORY AND KLEVU_CMS.
                 
                 For custom item types, we recommend a format like ACME_ENTITY,
                 where Acme is your company name, for example ACME_SHOP or ACME_RECIPE. -->
            <item_type>KLEVU_PRODUCT</item_type>
            
            <!-- REQUIRED for KLEVU_PRODUCT, OPTIONAL otherwise.
                 The Stock Keeping Unit code for an item. For compound
                 items, this will usually be the SKU of the Variant. -->
            <sku>ABC-123</sku>
            
            <!-- REQUIRED.
                 The name or title of the item.
                 For a compound item it is up to you whether to use
                 the title of the Parent or the title of the Variant.
                 
                 For example if you want to see the Variant data in search
                 results like "Joust Duffle Bag - Large" then use the Variant
                 title. If you prefer "Joust Duffle Bag" no matter which Variant
                 is being displayed, then use the Parent title. -->
            <title>Joust Duffle Bag</title>

            <!-- REQUIRED.
                 This is the URL to access your item.
                 It must start with either http:// or https:// 
                 
                 For compound items, you may wish to include some modifier to
                 allow you to pre-select a Variant directly from the search results.
                 For example: https://your.website/item-detail-page.html?v=12345 -->
            <link>https://your.website/item-detail-page.html</link>

            <!-- REQUIRED for KLEVU_PRODUCT, OPTIONAL otherwise.
                 This is the stock status of your item.
                 Allowed values are 'in stock' or 'out of stock' (case insensitive).
                 For compound items this should be the Variant stock status. -->
            <availability>In Stock</availability>
            
            <!-- OPTIONAL.
                 This is the date that the item was published on your website.
                 
                 You might use the created date or another date which represents
                 when the item was made publicly available. This is used by Klevu
                 for 'newness' ranking and also for the "Sort by Newest" sort order.
                 
                 For compound items it is up to you whether to use the Parent or
                 Variant data for the published date. If you wish to highlight new
                 Variant options being launched, use the Variant date. -->
            <published_at>1999-12-31T23:59:59​+0100</published_at>

            <!-- REQUIRED for KLEVU_PRODUCT, OPTIONAL otherwise.
                 These fields represent base currency prices of your item.
                 You must use the same base currency for all items in your feed.
                 
                 The format is similar to Google's Product price specification:
                 https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324371
                 
                 The price of your item is represented by two values: price and sale price.
                 <price/> is required for items of type KLEVU_PRODUCT, <sale_price/> is optional.
                 
                 If both values are provided, <price/> represents the 'was price' and
                 <sale_price/> represents the 'now price', eg. Was: 123.45, Now: 100.00. 
                 
                 For compound items please use the Variant's prices.
                 Klevu will automatically calculate lowest and highest prices
                 across all of the sibling Variants with the same <item_group_id/>. -->
            <price>123.45 GBP</price>
            <sale_price>100 GBP</sale_price>
            
            <!-- OPTIONAL.
                 If you wish to display additional currencies on your website,
                 populate the following with all additional values for <price/>
                 and <sale_price/>.
                 
                 For best results we recommend specifying the same set of
                 currencies for every item in your feed, and to always specify
                 values in complete pairs of <price/> and <sale_price/>.
                 
                 These additional currencies can be requested in search results
                 by using an API parameter. Any sorting or filtering will also
                 respect the currency-specific versions defined here. -->
            <additional_currencies>
                <additional_currency>
                    <price>151.84 USD</price>
                    <sale_price>123.00 USD</sale_price>

                <additional_currency>
                    <price>15240 JPY</price>

                </additional_currency>
            </additional_currencies>
            
            <!-- OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED.
                 These elements represent the images of your item.
                 They must start with either http:// or https://
                 
                 For compound items you can choose whether to use
                 the Parent image or the Variant image, in combination
                 with the value for <additional_image_link/>.
                 
                 For example if you want to first show the general
                 image and when the customer hovers show the specific
                 Variant image, populate <image_link/> with the Parent
                 image and <additional_image_link/> with the Variant image.
                  
                 If you require more images to display in search results,
                 please add an <attribute/> below with <is_return/> true. -->
            <image_link>https://your.website/image1.jpg</image_link>
            <additional_image_link>https://your.website/image2.png</additional_image_link>

                 Used to display swatches within your search results items.
                 
                 Populate <swatch_label/> with the value the swatch represents,
                 for example 'Red' or 'Leopard Print'.
                 
                 If your swatch is a block colour, populate <swatch_color/> with a HEX
                 code or valid colour to be used in CSS rendering. If your swatch is 
                 multicolour or patterned, you can instead provide a URL to an image of 
                 the swatch to be displayed, eg: https://your.website/swatches/leopard.png -->

                 Use this to override the Klevu manual boosting rules.
                 It is generally recommended to omit this entirely
                 and let Klevu A.I. rank your items accordingly.
                 
                 A value of 1 - 999 indicates a boosting up the rankings.
                 A value of 0 - 0.9 indicates a de-boosting down the rankings. -->

                 For compound products if your content differs per Variant,
                 you may wish to include the Variant short description for a
                 better chance customers will find your item, otherwise you can

                 We define these as `SimpleAttributeType`, which Klevu automatically
                 converts into a `ComplexAttributeType` using some pre-defined settings.
                 
                 These simple attributes can only contain a single value, eg 'Red'.
                 If you prefer more control over these attributes, omit them entirely

            <!-- OPTIONAL.
                 The following are additional attributes about your item which you
                 may freely define. You can specify multiple values for each attribute
                 and also whether it should be searchable and/or treated as a facet.
                 
                 <id/> is the unique identifier of your attribute.
                 
                 <name/> is the default label to be associated with the facet.
                 This can be overridden within the Klevu Merchant Centre.
                 
                 <is_facet/> is false by default. If you specify an attribute with <is_facet/> true,
                 it will automatically be searchable. A facet attribute will always be searchable.
                 
                 If you want an attribute to be searchable but not a facet, specify
                 <is_facet/> false. <is_searchable/> is true by default so no need to specify.

                 Define which categories your item belongs to.
                 
                 There are two ways to do this:
                 - <product_type/> (this method)
                 - <categories/> (recommended)
                 
                 You must choose one or the other.
                 If both are specified, only <categories/> will be processed.
                 
                 <product_type/> uses the Google format, with each category hierarchy separated
                 by a > or &gt; character. You can specify multiple <product_type/> elements to
                 represent each category which the item belongs to.
                 
                 Each section of each individual category hierarchy must be 100 characters or less.
                 For example, for <product_type>AAA > BBB > CCC</product_type> you must ensure
                 each of AAA, BBB and CCC are 100 characters or less.
                 
                 The value after the last `>` in each <product_type/> is included as a value for
                 the category facet. The entire structure is used for Klevu Smart Category Navigation.
                 The category names must exactly match those used in your store. -->
            <product_type>Men's &gt; Shoes &gt; Sneakers</product_type>
            <product_type><![CDATA[Men's>Shoes>Health & Fitness]]></product_type>
            
            <!-- WARNING:
                 If your category names contain > or &gt; you may
                 have problems with Klevu Smart Category Navigation.
                 
                 For example if a single category name is "Sale > Specials!",
                 Klevu would consider this as two nested categories:
                 - Sale
                 - - Specials!
                 
                 In this scenario you must either strip the character out,
                 rename your category or use the <categories/> approach below.-->

                 You must choose one or the other.
                 If both are specified, only <categories/> will be processed.
                 
                 Each <category/> represents a single category,
                 with each <path/> representing a segment of the hierarchy.
                 
                 The <path/> of each individual category hierarchy must be 100 characters or less.
                 For example, for <category><path>AAA</path><path>BBB</path></category> you must
                 ensure each of AAA and BBB are 100 characters or less.
                 
                 The last path is used as the value for the category facet.
